jwi - Java Wordnet Interface
============================

(Mavenized version of) JWI 2.3.3, based on http://repo.delver.io.
Now sidesteps the RandomAccessFile-based functionality to allow use with WordNet from classpath, including from a 
jar. This is in keeping with CCG's preferred way of doing things.
